*Published January 24, 2025*

Accessibility improves usability for everyone.

## Core Principles

- Semantic HTML
- Keyboard navigation
- Clear focus states

```html
<button aria-label="Close menu">X</button>
```

<blockquote data-callout="card" data-type="tip">
  <div><img src="/src/icons/icon-tip.svg" alt="Tip" /> Tip</div>
Accessibility improvements often benefit all users.
</blockquote>
