## Context and Motivation

Modern web development requires clarity, performance, and maintainability from day one.

For additional context, see:
[https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/)

<blockquote data-callout="card" data-type="info">
  <div><Icon  name="icon-info" />  Information</div>
Static-first thinking reduces complexity and improves predictability.
</blockquote>

---

## Practical Example

```js
export function example() {
  console.log("Example related to accessibility-first-development");
}
```

<blockquote data-callout="card" data-type="tip">
  <div><Icon  name="icon-tip" />  Tip</div>
Always measure before optimizing or refactoring.
</blockquote>

## Common Pitfalls

- Over-engineering
- Ignoring fundamentals
- Skipping documentation

<blockquote data-callout="card" data-type="warning">
  <div><Icon  name="icon-warning" /> Warning</div>
Small shortcuts often become long-term technical debt.
</blockquote>
