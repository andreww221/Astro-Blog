# Modern CSS Strategies

*Published January 22, 2025*

Modern CSS allows developers to build complex layouts with less code and fewer hacks.

---

## Layout Systems

Flexbox and Grid solve most layout problems.

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
}
```

---

## Utility-First CSS

Utility classes reduce context switching and encourage consistency.

<blockquote data-callout="card" data-type="info">
  <div><img src="/src/icons/icon-info.svg" alt="Info" /> Information</div>
Utility-first CSS works best with a defined design system.
</blockquote>
